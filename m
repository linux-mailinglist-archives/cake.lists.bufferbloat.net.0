=0AHi all -=0A =0AI've already shared my sadness and appreciation of my goo=
d friend Dave on LinkedIn.=0AI met him through Jim Gettys at the beginning =
of the Bufferbloat discovery, and besides our long correspondence, I hope I=
 have given him enough support over the years - including introducing him t=

himself. =0AHe's been a one-person social network out there, who got things=
 done beyond what institutions seem to be able to do. (And he amazed me by =
managing to get a stodgy IETF crowd to pay attention to the congestion cont=
rol issue, despite much institutional resistance, and academic networking r=
esearchers who never got the point). Of course, Jason Livingood worked behi=
nd the scenes very hard to bypass corporate resistance, too.=0A=0AAlso, I c=
an share something that few knew about - I brought Dave into an ex parte po=
licy discussion at the FCC about an idea being promoted that the FCC should=
 require all routers the FCC certified to have a complete "locked down" con=
figuration that could not be changed by users. I got brought in because of =
my FCC TAC involvement around Software Defined Radio. But the folks behind =
the proposal were just using that as an excuse - they wanted really to bloc=
k WISPs by raising the cost of WiFi routers. Dave, who knew more than anyth=
ing why re-flashing routers made them MORE secure and could explain it in a=
 disarming way to lawyers and policymakers, managed to get the commissioner=
s to understand that security wasn't something the FCC could certify, and a=
lso why commercial routers weren't at all secure. He was so much better at =
explaining in what you might call an inclusive, folksy way that he changed =
the FCC's approach significantly - away from Certifying Security entirely. =
(The SDR issue ended up not being relevant to routers, though SDR is still =
a complex policy issue that is holding back innovation in wireless systems.=

 way of solving critical problems in the 802.11 implementation and systems =
architecture domain. (Unfortunately, WiFi has become a political term that =
is being used by "wireless" operators and their suppliers to fight for or a=
gainst monopoly control of the airwaves, very parallel to the problems of g=
etting engineering solutions on Internet fabric that deal with congestion. =
